uSiteBuilder
============

Vega IT’s uSitebuilder is an open source (LPGL) framework created for .NET developers to accelerate and streamline their Umbraco based development projects. Our objective is to enable back-end developers to adhere to the .NET standards with minimal external interaction, and to facilitate the automation of their deployments.

uSiteBuilder gets released as a NuGet package and the latest stable release can be found at https://www.nuget.org/packages/uSiteBuilder/2.0.1
